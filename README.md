Psychology-Memory-Experiment
============================

Applet that shows letters and asks subjects to input the letters they saw, first in silence and then while talking aloud. The experimenter can view results and reset the procedure by resizing the window after the subject has left.

This applet was made for an introductive pscyhology class in high school. The applet provides a consistent showing to all subjects, which made it useful for the experiment.
In the experiment, I found that most subjects could not memorize as many letters while they were talking as when they were silent.
